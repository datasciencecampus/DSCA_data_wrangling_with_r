# Projects

* **‘New project…’** from the File menu, **‘New Directory’** to create a directory for the project.

* Future, select **‘Open Project…’** or **‘Recent Projects’** from the File menu.


![A file directory with your project_A.](images/level1.PNG)


* Benefit: your working directory will always be set to the project folder -> no need to worry about file paths.

???
As shown in the example below, where you include all files to a project in the same folder `Project A`



---
# Projects: file organisation

* **data** containing your raw and processed data.

* **images** containing photos you are using.

* **scripts** containing all the R script files.

![A file directory showing a project split into data, images, and script folders.](images/level2.PNG)


???

Within the folder, it is good practice to further organise your files within folders, as shown below.

---
# Importing Data

Before importing your data you need to know,

* Where it is stored?

* What kind of file it is?

* Are there any missing values in the data (denoted by `na`).

---
# File type

There are a variety of ways of reading data into R:

* `readr` - read csv, tsv

--

* `readxl` - excel, xlsx

--

* `haven` - SPSS, Stata and SAS files,

--

* `DBI` + `dplyr` or `dbplyr` - Databases,

--

* `jsonlite` - json files,

--

* `httr` - Web APIs,

--

* `rvest` - HTML (Web Scraping)

---
# Reading in a csv

```{r}

titanic_path <- file.path("../data", "titanic.csv")

titanic <- readr::read_csv(file = titanic_path)

```

---
# readxl

* Reads excel data into R (both `.xls` and `.xlsx`) formats.

```{r, eval = TRUE}

police_path <- file.path("../data", "police_data.xlsx")

police_data <- readxl::read_excel(path = police_path)

```


```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval = TRUE}
police_data %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed")) %>% 
  scroll_box(width = "100", height = "700px")
```
  

---
# readxl: dealing with multiple sheets

* the `excel_sheets()` function provides the names of the sheets without having to open the file.

```{r, eval=TRUE}
# To find out the excel sheet names from excel file

readxl::excel_sheets(police_path)
```


---
# Your Turn


1. Add an additional argument in the `read_excel` function to read in the second sheet (Table P1) from the police data.

```{r, eval = FALSE}

police_data <- read_excel(path = police_path,
                          _______ = _______)

```

Hint: Look at the help documentation by typing in ?read_excel, is there an argument that talks about "sheet"?

`r countdown(minutes = 5, seconds = 00)` 

---
# Answers

```{r, eval = FALSE}

police_data <- readxl::read_excel(path = police_path, 
                                  sheet = 2)

```

### OR

```{r, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

police_data <- readxl::read_excel(path = police_path, 
                                  sheet = "Table P1")

```




---
# readxl: specifying a cell range

* To get rid of blank rows we can specify a cell range. 

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval = TRUE}
police_data %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed")) %>% 
  scroll_box(width = "100", height = "700px")
```
  

---
# readxl: specifying a cell range


```{r, eval = TRUE}


police_data <- readxl::read_excel(path = police_path,
                                  sheet = 2, 
                                  range = "A5:AA48")


```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval = TRUE}
police_data %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed")) %>% 
  scroll_box(width = "100", height = "700px")
```

---
# haven

```{r, eval = FALSE}

spss_path <- file.path("folder", "file_name.sav")
read_spss(spss_path)


sas_path <- file.path("folder", "file_name.sas7bdat")
read_sas(sas_path)
```

* After running `library(haven)` try `?read_sas` and `?read_spss` to find out more.

---
# Exporting the Data

* `readr` allows us to export to csv file type or equivalent using the **`write.csv()`** function.

As an example we will export the police data we just imported.

```{r, eval=FALSE}

police_export_path <- file.path("../data", "test.csv")
readr::write_csv(police_data, path = police_export_path)

```

# Missing data: exploring the mechanisms

```
]
.right-plot[
```{r first-plot6, ref.label='first-plot6', echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
```
]

???

* By default, `ggplot` does not handle missing data. 

* This makes it hard to explore and to know where data is missing.

---
# Visualising something that's not there

.left-code[
```{r first-plot7, eval=FALSE}

.right-plot[
```{r first-plot7, ref.label='first-plot7', echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}

---
# Detecting unusual data

We can use `distinct` to look at the distinct values, e.g. siblings `sibsp`.

```{r}

titanic %>%
  distinct(sibsp)

```

???

This can help us identify anything unusual or also see what values come up.

---
# Detecting unusual data

For numeric variables we can use `summary` to get an idea of the spread of the data

```{r}

summary(titanic$fare)

```

Looking at the output of summary what is the maximum and minimum fare?

---
# Replacing values

* Replacing values using the statement `case_when()`. 

--


```{r}

titanic %>%
  mutate(survived = 
           case_when(survived == 1 ~ "yes", 
                     survived == 0 ~ "no")
         ) 

```

???


* `case_when()` is a two-sided formula where the left-hand side is a logical condition (yes or no) and the right-hand side is the value to assign when that test is `TRUE`, with the two sides separated by a `~`.


---
# Replacing values

* We may use `case_when()` to create a `quality_check` column.

```{r}

titanic %>%
  mutate(quality_check = case_when(fare > 100 ~ "outlier",
                                   fare <= 100 ~ "keep",
                                    TRUE ~ "missing") #<<
        ) %>%
  select(quality_check)

```


* Values not managed by the logical tests get a default replacement value: `NA`.

* If we prefer these values to not get an `NA` then we can use `TRUE ~ missing`

???
We do this by putting `TRUE` on the left hand side and the catch-all value on the right:

---
# Detecting duplicates

* Caused by combining data, data entry mistakes.

--

```{r}

data(mtcars)

janitor::get_dupes(dat = mtcars, mpg, hp)

```

--

```{r}

mtcars %>%
  get_dupes(wt)

```



???

Duplicates often creep into our datasets when we combine data from sources or can also accidentally occur during data entry. 

Like other functions that follow `tidyverse` principles. We can also use this function with the pipe.

We can use the function `get_dupes` from the R package `janitor` to identify duplicates. We need to specify the data frame (`dat`) and then the variable combination to search for duplicates and get back the duplicated rows.

---
# Removing duplicates

To remove duplicates and include only distinct rows, we can use the verb `distinct`.

```{r}

dim(titanic)

titanic_distinct <- titanic %>%
                        distinct()

dim(titanic_distinct)

```

---
# Removing duplicates

* `distinct` can also work with particular columns, e.g. if we wanted to represent only distinct fare types.


```{r}

dim(titanic)

titanic_distinct <- titanic %>%
                        distinct(fare, keep.all = TRUE)

dim(titanic_distinct)

```
---
# Removing duplicates

* `distinct` can also work with particular columns, e.g. if we wanted to represent only distinct fare types.


```{r}

head(titanic_distinct)

# Formatting data in a tidy format

Tidy data as defined in [*R for Data Science*](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/):

 * A **variable** is a quantity, quality, or property that you can measure.

--

 * A **value** is the state of a variable when you measure it. The value of a variable may change from measurement to measurement.
 
--

 * An **observation** is a set of measurements made under similar conditions.  An observation will contain several values, each associated with a different variable.
 
---
# Formatting data in a tidy format

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=900, fig.align='center', fig.cap="The iris data.frame with a green box around the variable sepal_length, a blue box around the first row observation, and a red box around the value 5.1 cm sepal length"}

knitr::include_graphics("images/tidy_iris_example.png")

``` 

---
# Exercise

Take a look at the titanic data.

* What are the variables?
* What is an example of a value?
* What are the observations?

`r countdown(minutes = 5, seconds = 00)` 

```{r}
head(titanic)
```

???

**Hint**

Remember, **variables** are the columns, a **value** is a cell, and an **observation** is a set of measurments made under similar conditions (e.g. in the case of the iris dataset a single flower).

---
# Answer

In this case the **variables** are 

```{r}
names(titanic)
```

---
# Answer 

A **value** would be a single value of one of these variables 

```{r}
titanic[1,"name_of_passenger"]
```

---
# Answer

And the **observation** would be all of the information recorded for a single person:

```{r}

titanic %>%
  filter(name_of_passenger == "Allen, Miss. Elisabeth Walton")

```

---
# Reshaping Data

```{r, echo = FALSE}

current_year <- year(today())

```

Let's go back `r current_year - 2000` years, and take a look at the top billboard top 100 charts in the USA from the year 2000. 

```{r}

data(billboard)

```


```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval = TRUE}
billboard %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed")) %>% 
  scroll_box(width = "100", height = "700px")
```

???
Now arranging the data as a table (in a wide-format) is a popular way to collect data as it optimises ease of data entry or ease of comparison. However, this format is not easy to analyse, especially within R which is optimised for vectorised operations (i.e. working with variables in columns).

Luckily there are two handy functions that we can use to **pivot** between the two. We can adjust the shapes of an object in R using the functions `pivot_longer` and `pivot_wider`.

---
# pivot_longer and pivot_wider

* `pivot_longer()` makes datasets **longer** by increasing the number of rows and decreasing the number of columns.

* `pivot_wider()` **widens** data, increasing the number of columns and decreasing the number of rows. 

The two functions are the inverse transformation of the other. 



???
Returning to our `billboard` dataset. Here the data encoded in the column names is really a number (which week). In this case we want the names to become a variable called `week`, and the values to become a variable called `rank`, that is what was the ranking of a particular song in a given week. 

---
# Reshaping the billboard data

```{r}

billboard %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = starts_with("wk"), 
    names_to = "week", 
    values_to = "rank"
  )

```

???

We can also add additional arguments. For instance, not every song stays in the charts for all 76 weeks, so the structure of the input data for the creation of unnecessary explicit `NA`s

---
# Reshaping the billboard data


```{r}

billboard_long <- billboard %>% 
                      pivot_longer(
                          cols = starts_with("wk"), 
                          names_to = "week", 
                          values_to = "rank",
                          values_drop_na = TRUE 
                      )


```


---
# Reshaping the billboard data

* We may also want `week` to appear as an integer instead of as a character.


```{r}

billboard %>% 
  pivot_longer(
      cols = starts_with("wk"), 
      names_to = "week", 
      names_prefix = "wk", 
      names_transform = list(week = as.integer), 
      values_to = "rank",
      values_drop_na = TRUE,
  )

```



---
# Reshaping: transforming to pivot_wider

Now if we want to transform the data back we can do this using `pivot_wider`

```{r}

billboard_long %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = week,
    values_from = rank
    )
    
```

---
# Reshaping the religion income

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval = TRUE}

data(relig_income)

relig_income %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed")) %>% 
  scroll_box(width = "100", height = "700px")
```

???

In this case the column names are character data that contain the income category. Within the cells are the counts of how many people are in that income range.

---
# Your turn

* We wish to reorganise the data so that the names of the columns, the income categories, are contained in a single variable called "income". 

* We want to make it so that the values, the number of people in each category, are contained in a single column called "count".  


```{r, eval = FALSE}
relig_income %>%
  pivot______(
    cols = !religion, # all columns but religion
    names_to = _____,
    values_to = _______)
```

???

To choose the right function, you'll want to think about, are we making our data "longer" or "wider"?

For the other aspects, we have a clue in the text.

We wish to reorganise the data so that the **names** of the columns, the income categories, are contained in a single variable called "income". We want to make it so that the **values**, the number of people in each category, are contained in a single column called "count". 

---
# Answer

```{r}
relig_income %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = !religion, # all columns but religion
    names_to = "income",
    values_to = "count")
```


---
# Reshaping: arranging data


To order the rows by the values of a column (low to high)

```{r}

titanic %>%
  arrange(fare)

```

To order the rows by the values of a column (high to low).

```{r}

titanic %>%
  arrange(desc(fare))

```

???
Another one of the dplyr verbs that comes in handy when we want to arrange data is `arrange`.

---
# Separate one column into several

```{r}

titanic2 <- titanic %>%
              separate(
                col = name_of_passenger, 
                into = c("last_name", "first_names"), 
                sep = ","
              )


```

---
# Unite several columns into one

```{r}

titanic2 %>%
  unite(col = "name_of_passenger", "last_name", "first_names",  sep = ",")

```

# Getting started


* For this adventure you'll need the `tidyverse` meta-package, `lubridate` (part of the tidyverse). We will also need the package `readxl`

# Dates and times in R

Type can be
1. A date (`<date>`)
2. A time (`<time>`)
3. A date-time (`<dttm>`) a date plus time. 

--

Can be built from

* Strings: 09/10/2010
* Existing date/time objects
* Date-time components (year = 1990, month = 12, day = 4)

# Parsing dates and times using helpers


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=600, fig.align='center', fig.cap = "Monsters in construction uniforms go through a pile of y's, m's, and d's to sort our years, months, and days respectively."}

knitr::include_graphics("images/lubridate_ymd.png")

# Parsing dates and times using helpers

* Identify the order in which the year (`y`), month (`m`), and day (`d`) appears in your dates.

* Let's look at October 2, 2020.

```{r}

ymd("20201002")

```

--

```{r, eval= FALSE}

___("10-02-2020")

```

# Parsing dates and times using helpers 


* For date-times, we can add an underscore and one of more `h` `m` and `s` to our parsing function.


* What helper would we use for October 3, 2020 if it comes in this format?

```{r, eval = FALSE}

____("03/10/20 15:32:05")

```

--

Times are supplied in `UTC`, the coordinated universal time, unless we specify a time zone (tz).

# A tale of 5 time zones...

Let's take a look at our training schedule 

```{r}

training_path <- file.path("../data", "training_schedule.xlsx")
schedule <- read_xlsx(training_path)

schedule <- schedule %>%
              mutate(date = as_datetime(date))

head(schedule)

```


---

# Getting components

We can pull out individual parts of a date with the **accessor** functions:

- year, month, day
- mday, yday, wday
- hour, minute, second

```{r}

schedule %>%
  mutate(year = year(date)) %>%
  head()

```
---

# Getting components

Fill in the blank to determine what day of the week our courses fall on

```{r, eval = FALSE}

schedule %>%
  mutate(weekday = ____(date)) 

```

We can change the arguments label = TRUE, abbr = FALSE.

# Creating a date time from date-time components

We can create a date-time by combining our date and start-time

```{r}

schedule <- schedule %>%
              mutate(
                start_date_time = make_datetime(
                  year = year(date), 
                  month = month(date), 
                  day = day(date), 
                  hour = start_time, 
                  tz = "Europe/London")
                )


```



```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}

schedule <- schedule %>%
              mutate(_______ = make_datetime(
                year = year(date), 
                month = month(date), 
                day = day(date), 
                hour = _______, 
                tz = "Europe/London")
                )


```


```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}

schedule <- schedule %>%
              mutate(end_date_time = make_datetime(
                year = year(date), 
                month = month(date), 
                day = day(date), 
                hour = end_time, 
                tz = "Europe/London")
                )


```

# Changing timezones with `with_tz`

But what is the time in Jamaica?

```{r}

schedule <- schedule %>%
              mutate(start_date_time_jam = with_tz(
                start_date_time, 
                tz = "America/Jamaica"))

```

# Having some fun


* Try changing the country to Belize

Hint: Run `OlsonNames(tzdir = NULL)` to find the correct time zone

```{r, eval = FALSE}

OlsonNames(tzdir = NULL)

schedule <- schedule %>%
              mutate(start_date_time___ = with_tz(
                start_date_time, 
                tz = "_____"))

```


Fill in the blanks to find out what time the delegates from Belize get to sleep in?

```{r, eval = FALSE}

schedule %>%
  filter(______(start_date_time____) > 7) %>%
  select(start_date_time_bz)

```

# Thinking about your projects

* What data cleaning do you need to do?
* What is the missing data like?
* What reshaping do you need to do?
* Do you work with dates?
